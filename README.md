# VideoChatProject
video chat project
Video chat app, users pick a username and room they will like to join and will be automatically connected in a video call to users already in the room. connections are made with webRTC using the simple-peer library. This app is not scalable due to it requiring a quadratic amount of connections relative to the amount of peers in the call.
